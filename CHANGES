[2.3.0]
- Changed the Actor-sizing algorithm (and thus fixed it for low `innerRadius` values).
- Integrated the propagation of the alpha from parent to children. Use the `setGlobalAlphaMultiplier(float)` method to do so.
- Fix for Widgets contained within a Table.
- Fix of the PieMenuStyle Colors-duplication.
- The `PieMenuSuggestedClickListener` now triggers a highlight on `touchDown` rather than waiting for the mouse to move after the initial click.
- HighlightChangeListener now extends EventListener. Removed the associated getter and setter: now `addListener()` should be used for that too.
- Style's `Circumference` values now include the `innerRadius` value.
- New API methods to allow more customization: `getActorDistanceFromCenter`, `getEstimatedRadiusAt`  and `adjustActorSize` can be changed to be whatever you want.

[2.2.0]
- Animated versions of the implementations are now available!

[2.1.0]
- Added a `defaultIndex` flag as a fallback value when an invalid index is being selected.
- Minor fix on the `PieMenu`'s `hit` method.

[2.0.0]
- The default of "infiniteSelectionRange" is now `false`.
- Removed the PieMenu.SuggestedClickListener inner class and made it its own class: PieMenuSuggestedClickListener.
- Removed the "manualVisibility" flag: it wasn't consistent enough and forced users to learn or guess about some internal workings.
- Removed the "highlightIsSelection" flag: it complexified the API despite there being the Highlight callback.
- Fixed a bug with the `selectIndex(int)` method.
- Preparing HTML-GWT set up.
- Multisampling from the DesktopLauncher for smoother recordings.

[1.0.0]
- Image child-Actors are now properly sized to remain within their sector.
- All of the examples are separated in different test classes for easy copy-paste.
- Even more API methods available to the public.
- Finished writing the JavaDoc.

[0.2.1-alpha]
- Refactoring the project's structure to resemble to other usual libGDX libraries.
- Opening up the API (more public methods accessible to users of the library).
- Including ShapeDrawer as a dependency by-default.

[0.1.1-alpha]
- JitPack deployment properly integrated.

[0.1.0-alpha]
- Initial code
- 5 different types of PieMenu are integrated and demonstrated.
