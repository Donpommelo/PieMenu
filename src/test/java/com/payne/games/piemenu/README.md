# Tests
Welcome! You were look for tests? Here they are!

Depending on whether you are someone which is trying to figure out how to integrate a PieMenu into your game (aka an [Integrator](#integrators)), or someone which is trying to help this library grow (aka a [Contributor](#contributors)), you've come to the right place.

### Integrators
You want to get your code samples from [the ``codeExamples`` package](https://github.com/payne911/PieMenu/tree/master/src/test/java/com/payne/games/piemenu/codeExamples).

You might also want to check out [the Wiki Page](https://github.com/payne911/PieMenu/wiki/Examples) dedicated to all of that stuff.

### Contributors
After forking the project, you can use the ``DesktopLauncher`` to see a list of all the tests available for you to try out whether or not you've broken anything with your contributions.

To get some inspiration, you might also want to check out [the Wiki Page](https://github.com/payne911/PieMenu/wiki/Contributing) which lists some of the features that are needed.
