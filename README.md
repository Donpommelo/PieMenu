# PieMenu
A library to obtain a PieMenu functionality within LibGDX.

### Demo

Generally, the controls are:
* ``RIGHT-CLICK`` : opens a PieMenu meant for selection through dragging (don't release the right-click until you want to select the highlighted item).
* ``MIDDLE-CLICK`` : opens a PieMenu meant for "normal" selection. You can release the button and select as you wish with a left-click.
* ``CTRL`` (the left one): toggles the visibility of the "permaPie" at the bottom of the screen.
* ``TAB`` : toggles the style used for the "middle-click" menu.
* ``BACKSPACE`` : removes a Child from a few RadialWidgets.
* ``SPACE`` : adds a Child to a few of the RadialWidgets.
* ``F5`` : "restarts" the application. Everything will be back to what it was initially.

### Thanks to
* raelus
* mgsx
* EarlyGrey (I'm actually entirely dependent on his library: [ShapeDrawer](https://github.com/earlygrey/shapedrawer))

For their sustained help through the LibGDX discord `#scene2d` channel. Their extensive knowledge of the scene2d API was greatly appreciated.

### Credits
I used some images from [Game-Icons.net](https://game-icons.net/), more specifically the 5 icons displayed when clicking the "Toggle Radial" button. To be even more specific, the credits go to [Lorc](http://lorcblog.blogspot.com/).

Also, raelus made the background image for the "middle-click menu".
